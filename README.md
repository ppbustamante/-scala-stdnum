# scala-stdnum

A Scala library to parse, validate and reformat standard numbers and codes in different formats. It contains a large
collection of number formats.

Basically any number or code that has some validation mechanism available or some common formatting is eligible for
inclusion in this library.

## Available formats

Currently, this package supports the following formats:

- DNI (Documento Nacional de Identidad, Argentinian national identity nr.)
- RUT (Rol Ãšnico Tributario, Chilean national tax number)

Basically any number or code that has some validation mechanism available or some common formatting is eligible for
inclusion into this library.

These modules generally do not provide background information on the meaning and use of the specified numbers, only
parsing and handling functions.

## Interface

All modules implement a common interface. For example for RUT validation:

```scala
scala >

import com.closure.stdnum.cl.RUT

scala > RUT.validate("39.232.415-1")
val res0: Either[com.closure.stdnum.exceptions.ValidationError, String] = Right(392324151)

scala > RUT.validate("23.431.324-3")
val res1: Either[com.closure.stdnum.exceptions.ValidationError, String] = Left(com.closure.stdnum.exceptions.InvalidChecksum)
```

Most of these modules implement the following functions:

- `validate()` validate the correctness of the passed number and return a compact representation of the number invalid
  numbers are rejected with one of the exceptions from the stdnum.exceptions module
- `compact()` return a compact representation of the number or code this function generally does not do validation but
  may raise exceptions for wildly incorrect numbers
- `format()` return a formatted version of the number in the preferred format this function generally expects to be
  passed a valid number or code

Apart from the above, the module may add extra parsing, validation or conversion functions.

## Requirements

The modules should not require any external Scala library and should be pure Scala. The modules are developed and tested with Scala 3.
